# 21DaysOfSolidity
WWCode Blockchain has organized a 21 Days Solidity Smart Contract Challenge. One Smart Contract problem statement was given every alternate day.


Day 1: Write a smart contract that will take in two integers and return the sum of those two integers.

Day 3:
a) Write a smart contract that will sort an array of real values and return the sorted array.
b) Write a smart contract that will take in an address and a corresponding value that is assumed to be the amount of ethers stored at that address. Create a function, that would return the address with maximum ethers in it.
