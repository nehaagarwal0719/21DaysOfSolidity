# 21DaysOfSolidity
WWCode Blockchain has organized a 21 Days Solidity Smart Contract Challenge. One Smart Contract problem statement was given every day.


Day 1: Write a smart contract that will take in two integers and return the sum of those two integers.

Day 2: Write a smart contract that will sort an array of real values and return the sorted array.

Day 3: Write a smart contract that will take in an address and a corresponding value that is assumed to be the amount of ethers stored at that address. Create a function, that would return the address with maximum ethers in it.

Day 4: Smart contract to create a portal for candidates who are going to represent the states in an upcoming election.
Write a smart contract that will perform the following functions:
Create a function to register a candidate with the following parameters:
- CandidateID
- Candidate Name
